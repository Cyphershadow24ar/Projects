# Setting Up the Environment
Initialize a New Go Module

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your desired project directory, and initialize a new Go module:

# bash

mkdir snake-game
cd snake-game
go mod init snake-game
Install Ebiten

Fetch the Ebiten library using go get:

# bash

go get github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2

This command downloads the Ebiten library and adds it to your go.mod file.

# Running the Game
# Navigate to Your Project Directory
Ensure you're in the snake-game directory where main.go is located.

# Build and Run the Game
You can run the game directly using the go run command:
bash
go run main.go

# Alternatively, you can build an executable:
bash
go build

This command creates an executable file named snake-game (or snake-game.exe on Windows) in your directory. Run it by executing:

# On macOS/Linux:
bash
./snake-game

# On Windows:
bash
snake-game.exe

# Gameplay Instructions
# Controls:
Arrow Keys or W/A/S/D to change the snake's direction.
R to restart the game after a game over.

# Objective:
Guide the snake to eat the red food squares.
Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and your score increases.
Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

# Game Over:
If the snake collides with a wall or itself, the game ends.
Press R to restart the game.



Thought for a few seconds

Certainly! Creating a Snake game in Go is an excellent way to practice your programming skills and familiarize yourself with game development concepts. In this guide, we'll use the Ebiten library, a simple and powerful 2D game library for Go.

Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Go Language: Download and install Go from the official website. To verify the installation, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

bash
Copy code
go version
Git: Required for fetching dependencies. Download it from here if you don't have it installed.

Setting Up the Environment
Initialize a New Go Module

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your desired project directory, and initialize a new Go module:

bash
Copy code
mkdir snake-game
cd snake-game

Copy code
go get github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2
This command downloads the Ebiten library and adds it to your go.mod file.

Writing the Snake Game Code
Create a new file named main.go in your snake-game directory and open it in your favorite text editor. Paste the following code into main.go:

go
Copy code

Running the Game
Navigate to Your Project Directory

Ensure you're in the snake-game directory where main.go is located.

Build and Run the Game

You can run the game directly using the go run command:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go
Alternatively, you can build an executable:

bash
Copy code
go build
This command creates an executable file named snake-game (or snake-game.exe on Windows) in your directory. Run it by executing:

On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy code
./snake-game
On Windows:

bash
Copy code
snake-game.exe
