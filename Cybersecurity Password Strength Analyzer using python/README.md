The Code Explanation:-

Let's break down the script to understand how it evaluates password strength.

1. Importing the re Module
python

import re
re: Python's built-in module for regular expressions, used here to match patterns within the password.

2. Defining the password_strength Function
python

def password_strength(password):
    """
    Evaluates the strength of a given password.

    Parameters:
    password (str): The password string to evaluate.

    Returns:
    str: Strength category of the password.
    """
Parameters:
password: The password string input by the user.
Returns:
A string indicating the strength category of the password.

3. Initializing the Score
python

score = 0
score: A numerical value representing the strength of the password based on the criteria met.

4. Defining Criteria Patterns
python

length_pattern = r'.{8,}'  # At least 8 characters
lowercase_pattern = r'[a-z]'
uppercase_pattern = r'[A-Z]'
digit_pattern = r'\d'
special_char_pattern = r'[\W_]'  # Non-alphanumeric characters
common_passwords = ['password', '123456', '123456789', 'qwerty', 'abc123']
length_pattern: Checks if the password is at least 8 characters long.
lowercase_pattern: Checks for at least one lowercase letter.
uppercase_pattern: Checks for at least one uppercase letter.
digit_pattern: Checks for at least one digit.
special_char_pattern: Checks for at least one special character (non-alphanumeric).
common_passwords: A sample list of commonly used passwords to prevent using easily guessable passwords.

5. Checking for Common Passwords
python

if password.lower() in common_passwords:
    return "Very Weak (Common Password)"
Converts the input password to lowercase and checks if it exists in the common_passwords list. If it does, the password is immediately categorized as "Very Weak."

6. Evaluating Each Criterion
python

# Length check
if re.search(length_pattern, password):
    score += 1

# Lowercase letters
if re.search(lowercase_pattern, password):
    score += 1

# Uppercase letters
if re.search(uppercase_pattern, password):
    score += 1

# Digits
if re.search(digit_pattern, password):
    score += 1

# Special characters
if re.search(special_char_pattern, password):
    score += 1
For each criterion met, the score is incremented by 1.
7. Determining Password Strength
python
Copy code
if score == 0:
    return "Very Weak"
elif score == 1:
    return "Weak"
elif score == 2:
    return "Moderate"
elif score == 3:
    return "Strong"
elif score >= 4:
    return "Very Strong"
Based on the total score, the password is categorized into one of the strength levels.

8. The main Function
python

def main():
    print("=== Password Strength Analyzer ===")
    password = input("Enter a password to evaluate: ")
    strength = password_strength(password)
    print(f"Password Strength: {strength}")
Purpose: Serves as the entry point of the script.
Functionality: Prompts the user to enter a password, evaluates its strength, and displays the result.

9. Running the Script
python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Ensures that the main function runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.
Example Usage
Let's walk through an example to see how the Password Strength Analyzer works.

Scenario 1: Weak Password
Input:
css
Enter a password to evaluate: pass

Output:
java
Password Strength: Very Weak (Common Password)

Explanation:
"pass" is a common password and is immediately flagged as "Very Weak."
Scenario 2: Moderate Password
Input:
css
Enter a password to evaluate: Pass123

Output:
yaml
Password Strength: Moderate

Explanation:
Length: 7 characters (does not meet the 8-character minimum).
Contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits.

Total score: 3 (but length not met, categorized as "Moderate").
Scenario 3: Strong Password
Input:

css
Enter a password to evaluate: Passw0rd!
Output:
less
Password Strength: Strong

Explanation:

Length: 9 characters.
Contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Total score: 5, categorized as "Very Strong."
